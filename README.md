## Overview
The Tableau Story can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/luis.eduardo.leal/viz/NYCCitiBike_16538458102470/Story1).

The aim of this project is to analyze data from New York City's CitiBike to convince investors of a business proposal for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis helps answer common questions about the program: 
  
  * How much are the bikes used?
  * Who uses the bikes the most?
  * What are the times of day that usage is seen most or least?
  * Who uses the program?

## Results

While the demographics of Des Moines may be different from that of New York City, it can provide some insight on the general use of the program.
